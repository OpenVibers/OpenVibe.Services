/**
 * Per-actor rate limits at Services' capability boundaries (roadmap WS-R task 4; openvibe-sdk/limits):
 * /api/v1, the signed-in portal (/projects), release actions, the developer tools' forms and the
 * staff trust form.
 *
 * The per-address limits in app.js and the routers (pages 300 a minute, portal writes 60, the tools and
 * API writes 30 and 60, sign-in) and the playground's runs an hour per person stay. These count
 * requests by who makes them:
 *
 *   an app                 its principal, app:app_… (the token requireCapability verified on /api/v1)
 *   a person               user:usr_… (the signed-in session sso.middleware verified)
 *   anyone else            ip:<address>
 *
 * Services hosts no git remotes: there are no clone or push routes to leave out. Past a limit the route
 * answers 429 problem+json `rate_limited` with Retry-After before it does any work (before the form or
 * upload is read, before Network is asked); the refusal is logged once and counted in
 * services_rate_limited_total{limit,window}. Reads take SERVICES_LIMITS_MINUTE / SERVICES_LIMITS_HOUR (120 and
 * 3000); every write has its own number below. Counters live in this process: a restart forgets them.
 *
 * Never limited: /api/health, /api/ready, /release.json, /metrics, sign-in, and the public pages and
 * docs (the per-address limit bounds them).
